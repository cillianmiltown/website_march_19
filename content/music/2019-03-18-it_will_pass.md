## The Race 
**Vocals**: Cillian McHugh<br>
**Guitars**: Cillian McHugh

What if you, if you were in my shoes?<br>
Would they fit? And would they keep you warm?<br>
What if you, if you were in my shoes?<br>
What have I missed?<br>

Time...<br>
Time...<br>
Time...<br>
Goes on, moves fast<br>

Stealing words of green tinted blue<br>
Shadows of what we thought we knew<br>
No more...<br>

... time<br>
... time<br>
... time<br>
is caught up, is made up<br>

All good things come to an end<br>
All good things come to an end<br>

You don’t want them to<br>
You don’t want them to<br>

And all you’ve lived and all you own,<br>
and all you’ve learned an all you’ve known<br>
And all you’ve worked and all you’ve done<br>
And everything you’ve become<br>

And you don’t even know<br>
And you don’t even know<br>
And you don’t even know<br>
And you don’t even know<br>

And those you’ve loved and those you’ve known<br>
And those you’ve seen and those you’ve shown<br>
The ones who knew and understood<br>
The ones you thought would stay for good<br>

And you have to say goodbye<br>
And you have to say goodbye<br>
And you have to say goodbye<br>
And you have to say goodbye<br>


## There Are No Words
**Vocals**: Cillian McHugh<br>
**Guitar**: Cillian McHugh

There are no words, there are no words, there's just hanging on <br>
And holding out, and holding on, until it's gone<br>
Your broken heart, your broken heart, you thought had healed<br>

You check the screen, you check the screen for any sign<br>
For her reply, for her reply, but you know inside<br>
The empty screen and what that means, it's all you feel<br>

You came too close, you got too close, like you did before<br>
And every time, and every time, no matter what you try<br>
Will come again, will come again...<br>

## Counting the Days
**Vocals**: Cillian McHugh<br>
**Guitar**: Cillian McHugh

Walking home across the city from the train to the plane<br>
You're on your own, there's no pity there's no pain in vain<br>
When you said good-bye on the platform this time<br>
Like you said good-bye the first time<br>

You know this place by day but it's night this time<br>
Cold breeze on your face, night air and the city lights shine<br>
Across the water reflect the sights<br>
Across the water you'll trek tonight<br>

Growing apart, time and distance will take their toll<br>
But in your heart you know it's wort it to make you whole<br>
The signs are there but hope remains<br>
'Cause love is to share, it's worth the strain<br>

Back on land back to normal doubt left behind<br>
You're almost home, just the drive and in your mind<br>
You count the days till the next time<br>
Like you count the days each time

What if the best advice was wrong?<br>
Advice you followed for too long.<br>
And you turn to the bottle or the rolling good times,<br>
Did you find it there? Do you even care?<br>

I remember the secret joy,<br>
I remember your voice......<br>
........your eyes.....<br>

I don't know if i care for you,<br>
And I don't know if you want me to.<br>
I don't know.............<br>
....You.....<br>

I don't care if you miss me too<br>
Coz I don't care (how I felt for you)<br>
Coz if I care.......<br>
I'd care<br>


## It Will Pass
**Vocals**: Cillian McHugh<br>
**Guitar**: Cillian McHugh

Too many times,<br>
But it will pass and come again,<br>
As history plays out, the cycle comes round again.<br>
And it's back to the drawing board but you know its the same song over again<br>
same song over again.....same song over again<br>

You can only be a happy fool for so long,<br>
Till you have to face the truth and accept that you've got it wrong.<br>
And poets of the past speak truths that will always last<br>
And the band sings your heart, drawing distractions<br>

Too many times,<br>
But it will pass and come again.

And you know it’s done, and you know it’s too late to talk<br>
‘cause nothing you can say, and nothing you can do will change what’s come<br>
And you always knew this day could come,<br>
But your heart still believed<br>

Believed you could overcome, believed she was the one,<br>
You tried to make it work, you thought you could make it work,<br>
And even when the cracks began to show,<br>
You never gave up hope<br>

The four leaf charm, to hang on her arm,<br>
The phone call in the sun, remembering as one, one last time<br>
Back to how it used to be<br>
and what we had.<br>

Two months on, the time you bought is gone,<br>
Today’s flight home, the last flight home<br>
