I have been playing music from a young age and started writing songs as a teenager. Influences range from heavy, multi-instrumental Prog (Yes, Rush, Pink Floyd and Genesis) to more traditional acoustic folk and blues (Neil Young, Eric Bibb and Tom Waits) and everything in between.

I have released 2 albums to date: *Back to the Drawing Board* was released in 2012, and *It Will Pass...* was released in 2019. Both albums are available online (itunes/Spotify/Google Play Music etc.), and can be listened to below. Check out [Cillian Mc Hugh](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4YrhGzeBXwDn6FM4WfI8b1) on Spotify. Have a listen to the new album below. I also have the unreleased *Spectrum* which included some songs that made it onto *Back to the Drawing Board* along with some longer songs that reflect my Prog influences. Some material from *Spectrum* is available on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/cillianmchugh) (in particular see [this playlist](https://soundcloud.com/cillianmchugh/sets/long-songs)).
